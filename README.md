# Web Development Bootcamp

This repo is used to track my learning journey of `The Complete 2021 Web Development Bootcamp`([course link](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/)) on Udemy. The course resources list can be found [here](https://www.appbrewery.co/p/web-development-course-resources).

## Project Highlights
All the projects deployed on Heroku (using Node.js runtime environment and Express.js web framework):
- TinDog ([here](https://gentle-harbor-90753.herokuapp.com/)): This is a complete website built with HTML and CSS including Bootstrap library.
- Simon Game ([here](https://peaceful-sierra-73549.herokuapp.com/)): You can play the Simon Game using PC only. The game requires keystroke inputs. If you don't know how to play the Simon Game, please click on [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Yqj76Q4jJ4) for a minute introduction. In this website, I learned how to cooperate HTML with jQuery.
- To-Do List ([here](https://aqueous-reef-84998.herokuapp.com/)): The website connects to MongoDB Atlas cloud database to keep the to-do tasks. In addition, EJS is adpted for templating.
- Keeper ([here](https://hidden-hamlet-57066.herokuapp.com/)): The Keeper app has the functionality to take notes just like Google Keep! The website is made with React and JSX. The state hook is used to handle the change of note creation and submission. Using pre-built React components, I add zoom in animation and icons to enrich the app.
